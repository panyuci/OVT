DEFAULT - Default; a quasi-Newton type solver
FAST - This is the initial recommended setting; Levenberg-Marquardt type with repetitive start
GNSS - Gauss Newton Subspace Solver
SIMPLEX - Nelder-Mead minimization
LRU - Low rank update; the LRU optimizer combines a Gauss-Newton trust region approach with a low rank update for both the Jacobian and Hessian matrices.
QP - Quadratic Programming approach
MIN SMOOTH - Square approximation minimizer, based on Powell's method; The minimized function is assumed to be differentiable and the constraints are assumed to be differentiable, at least on the domain border. 
DE - Differential Evolution solver"]

When CALIBRATE = true, the input to this heading is treated as an initial guess by the solver that performs model calibration; 
when CALIBRATE = false, the input is used directly.","-FLAT - For flat time-independent calibration; during calibration, a single value is used for the parameter for all possible maturities.
-STEP - For time-dependent calibration, i.e., the value of the parameter depends on time For time-dependent model parameters, time direction interpolation is needed when the model parameter is needed in
between the time nodes. The time nodes are determined from all the available tenors and/or maturities in the model calibration instruments.
-LINEAR","Indicates the way interpolation is to be performed
The input to the INTERPOLATION TYPE heading is effective only in special cases; an example of such a case is when there is a user-provided initial guess in terms of a curve that is based on a set of dates different from those of the calibration instruments. In this case, the specified interpolation method is used to get the initial guess for the corresponding calibration date. However, if the model calibration convergence is perfect, then the interpolation method will not affect the result. Only when the user chooses not to calibrate by setting CALIBRATE = false (this is a less common use case) would there be
some difference in the result.
Specific support for methods may vary by model. For example, for CMDTY model calibration curves, interpolation is restricted to two types: FORWARD STEP and BACKWARD STEP. The choice affects the representation of the curve, but not the numerical results.

Because of this, it needs a seed
determining a concrete sequence of the pseudo random numbers. The numbers are
drawn from the same type of probability distribution and stochastically are similar
but physically differ and allow studying the influence of randomness, which is an
inevitable property of the DE solver. It must be a positive integer number.","The type of solver to use in the calibration of a model on a generic tree. 
-DEFAULT - a quasi-Newton type solver
-FAST - This is the initial recommended setting; Levenberg-Marquardt type with repetitive start
-GNSS - Gauss Newton Subspace Solver 
-SIMPLEX - Nelder-Mead minimization
-LRU - Low rank update; the LRU optimizer combines a Gauss-Newton trust region approach with a low rank update for both the Jacobian and Hessian matrices.
-QP - Quadratic Programming approach 
-MIN SMOOTH - Square approximation minimizer, based on Powell's method; The minimized function is assumed to be differentiable and the constraints are assumed to be differentiable, at least on the domain border.","Directs the solver to do a multi-step calibration where each successive calibration step starts with an initial guess equal to the result of the previous step. When this heading is set, calibration is repeated
until the ratio of the final accuracy to the initial accuracy becomes greater than the CONVERGENCE value. The initial recommended setting is 0.95. For better convergence, the recommended setting is
0.99.

Double; default is 0.1; it can be set smaller to reduce noise in complicated tasks.","For a DE solver, this is the size of a generation. As a given, it remains constant

POPULATION for a DE solver is 15. For a GA solver, this is the size of the
\"population\" vector, where each element (or individual) is a set of model parameters.
The GA solver runs an \"evolution cycle\" to generate a new population by minimizing
the \"fitness\", which is the least squares fit to the set of option prices. The solver
starts by setting up an initial population, essentially as a set of random numbers. The new generation is produced depending on the parameter settings of the GA solver","Number of generations considered by the DE solver during the space search; must be
